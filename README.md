## Welcome to SigmaRL!
This repository provides the full code of **SigmaRL**, a <ins>S</ins>ample eff<ins>i</ins>ciency and <ins>g</ins>eneralization <ins>m</ins>ulti-<ins>a</ins>gent <ins>R</ins>einforcement <ins>L</ins>earning (MARL) for motion planning of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs).

SigmaRL is a decentralized MARL framework designed for motion planning of CAVs. We use <a href="https://github.com/proroklab/VectorizedMultiAgentSimulator" target="_blank">VMAS</a>, a vectorized differentiable simulator designed for efficient MARL benchmarking, as our simulator und customize our own RL environment. The first scenario in [Fig. 1](#) mirrors the real-world coditions of our Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab (<a href="https://cpm.embedded.rwth-aachen.de/" target="_blank">CPM Lab</a>). Besides, we also support maps handcrafted in <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/" target="_blank">JOSM</a>, an open-source editor for OpenStreetMap. [Below](#customize-your-own-maps) you will find detailed guidance to create your **OWN** maps.

## Install
We use Python 3.9. Other versions may also work well. After git clone this repository, install the necessary packages using
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
We have tested this repository and confirmed that it works well on Windows and macOS. You may need to take additional steps to make it work on Linux.

## How to Use
### Training
Run `/main_training.py`. During training, all the intermediate models that have higher performance than the saved one will be automatically saved. You are also allowed to retrain or refine a trained model by setting the parameter `is_continue_train` in the `config.json` from the root directory file to `true`. The saved model will be loaded for a new training process.

`/scenarios/road_traffic.py` defines the RL environment, such as observation function and reward function. Besides, it provides an interactive interface, which also visualizes the environment. To open the interface, simply run this file. You can use `arrow keys` to control agents and use the `tab key` to switch between agents. Adjust the parameter `scenario_type` to choose a scenario. All available scenarios are listed in the variable `SCENARIOS` in `utilities/constants.py`. It is recommended to use the virtual visualization to check if the environment is as expected before training.
### Testing
After training, run `/main_testing.py` to test your model. You may need to adjust the parameter `path` therein to tell which folder the target model was saved.
*Note*: If the path to a saved model changes, you need to update the value of `where_to_save` in the corresponding JSON file as well.

## Customize Your Own Maps
We support maps customized in <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/" target="_blank">JOSM</a>, an open-source editor for ​OpenStreetMap. Follow these steps:
- Install and open JOSM, click the green download button
- Zoom in and find an empty area (as empty as possible)
- Select the area by drawing a rectangle
- Click "Download"
- Now you will see a new window. Make sure there is no element. Otherwise, redo the above steps.
- Customize lanes. Note that all lanes you draw are considered center lines. You do not need to draw left and right boundaries, since they will be determined automatically later by our script with a given width.
- Save the osm file and store it at `assets/maps`. Give it a name.
- Go to `utilities/constants.py` and create a new dictionary for it. You should at least give the value for the key `map_path`, `lane_width`, and `scale`.
- Go to `utilities/parse_osm.py`. Adjust the parameters `scenario_type` and run it.
